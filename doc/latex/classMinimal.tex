\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
for all \mbox{\hyperlink{classDobby}{Dobby}} notification events.

Since we already run a different thread to send out notificiations there is no need for this to do anything fancy, just call the notification function. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
client/lib/source/Dobby\+Proxy.\+cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
